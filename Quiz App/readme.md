Radio Button
 By giving same name attribute while making radio button so that only one option will be selected
  Radio buttons only permit one selection from the group, hence they all have the same name attribute-->
  input "id" and label "for" must be the same value so that while clicking on labels will help to enter values in radio

  input tag has aproperty called checked which will select the element

Here we have one question and 3 options
we need to make it dynamic because we have more questions and options

we can store date in variables arrays objects etc in JS
if we need to store one value we can use variable
Array can be used to store question and answers but we cant say what is it related,
so its better to give in it as "array of objects" as key value of pairs including the answer of each question

so we need to show this question and answer in DOM

call each element and insert the content in DOM
